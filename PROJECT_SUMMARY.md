   - `velociraptor/server.config.yaml` - Velociraptor server settings
   - `velociraptor/acls.yaml` - Access control configuration
   - `.env` - Environment variables and credentials

4. **Management Scripts**
   - `scripts/startup.sh` - Initialize and start all services
   - `scripts/shutdown.sh` - Stop and clean up
   - `scripts/status.sh` - Check service health
   - `scripts/test.sh` - Run connectivity and functionality tests

5. **Documentation**
   - `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation (13+ sections)
